Nature's first green is gold,
Her hardest hue to hold.
Her early leaf's a flower,
But only so an hour.
The leaf subsides to leaf,
So Eden sank to grief.
So dawn goes down to day,
Nothing gold can stay.\
The end! Goodbye!

- Robert Frost
Robert Lee Frost was born on March 26, 1874. He died on January 29, 1963.

(I found this poem in a book. It is very pretty. The book I found it in is Outsiders by S.E Hinton.)
